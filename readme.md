##Technologies Used

* React- structure our front end
* PSQL- store our data
* Express- backend server
  
####API Used 

  * [Expedia](http://developer.expedia.com/directory)



##General Approach

We began with the idea that it would be nice to offer users a way to plan an entire vacation package (place to stay plus things to do) within their local vicinity. We first attempted to use the AirBnb API and FourSqaure API, however parsing through their data proved to be a challenge. We settled on using the Expedia API as not only was it all inclusive (activities plus hotel locations) but it was a lot more flexible to parse through.

##Unsolved Problems/ Open Issues
* Frontend Authentication with React
(we were able to get our backend server to set tokens, but weren't able in a timely manner to get the tokens to pass through to frontend.)
*Database - needed constant restructuring
